There is no doubt that the terms libraries and Freamworks have become frequent between new and veteran programmers, so what do they mean and what is the difference between them?

Library
===========
It is a set of code and files written by other programmers to perform a specific task. Suppose you need to deal with numbers. Instead of writing these functions, you will search for a library with these functions you want and use this library, or you create your own library of the properties you want and keep them For reuse, you can publish it for reuse by others who are looking for those same features in your library.
=================================================
Framework
=====
The framework or framework is simply a pre-equipped environment with some tools, technologies and libraries that other programmers have built, tested and built so that anyone can use them easily to help you and make your programming easier for you, it makes the programmer start where the others ended, for example: In your project, you needed to deal with databases, so instead of building algorithms to deal with this, you can use a framework to help you with that.
For example, if we talk about the PHP language and some of the Freamworks available to it, we will find (Laravel, CodeIgniter, CakePHP), to name a few. These Freamworks are nothing but a set of pre-made PHP files that allow you to create your program in the style of (MVC: model - view). - controller) and thus saved you from creating a system from scratch and also provided you with the basic techniques that allow you to use them to develop your program, if the framework is not a ready-made program. It is an environment in which the tools it provides can be used to produce a program.
Another example, Twitter Boostrap is a framework for designers related to web design development. This framework provides you with a set of Jquery libraries and a set of ready-made Css files that you can use directly in developing your application design on the Internet, thus saving time, effort and cost for you as a developer of this application.
========================
Framework vs Libary
- Quite simply, the library is found to help you in carrying out one task, while the framework is a group of libraries combined together to perform some tasks.
- If you are using a specific library in a project and you want to replace it with another library, you can do so easily while the framework cannot be replaced by another and the reason is because you will write the project again on the new framework.
The library is a tool, while the framework is a programming method.
Libraries run or install through the framework.
