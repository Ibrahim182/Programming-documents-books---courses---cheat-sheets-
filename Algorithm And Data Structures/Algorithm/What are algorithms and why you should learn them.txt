What are algorithms
And why should you learn it?

âœ´ Algorithm:
It is a set of specific steps
The sequence needed to solve a problem
or in order to perform a specific task.

Example
Age calculation algorithm.
Current year - year of birth = age
2021 - 2001 = 20

Another example .
Ahmed wants to go to the museum.
Suggested methods (algorithms).
1 - Hire a taxi
2- Using public transportation

In order to determine the best way to go to the museum
 Among the roads above
Two main points must be understood
1 - Time (calculating the time taken to reach the museum)

2- The material cost of each method

â­• - taxi
Very expensive, but in less time

â­• - Public transportation
Less cost but more time than a taxi

After knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each method, the best solution must be chosen that suits Ahmed's budget ðŸ˜Ž

If Ahmed has enough money, he chooses
â­• Taxi

If he does not have enough money, he will choose
â­• Public transportation.

âœ´ Algorithms in programming.
is a set of clear code that
 They are executed one after the other in sequence
 to solve a problem.

The study of algorithms is concerned with two important factors.

 â­• Time complexity
  The time the computer spends executing the algorithm
 
 â­• Space complexity
  The amount of memory the program used to implement the algorithm.

Example.
â­• Make a program to add numbers from 1 to 1000
(1 + 2 + 3 +...... 1000)

Methods of solution
âœ´ Use of repetition functions
We create a repeating function that combines numbers from 1 to 1000

using javascript
``` js
let total = 0;
for(let i = 1 ; i <= 1000; i++) {
    total += i;
}
console.log(total);
```
Use this method
It won't use much memory
But the implementation time is very long.

âœ´ Using the following rule
Sum = N * (N + 1) / 2

where N = the number we want to add to

``` js
function sumTo(n) {
    return ((n + 1) * n) / 2;
}

let total = sumTo(1000)

console.log(total)
```
this method
You don't need much time
And it doesn't use a lot of memory

âœ³ Algorithm Quality Factors
Short execution time
âœ´ You don't need to use much memory
âœ´ Clear and easy to understand steps
âœ´ Accurately define input and output

âœ³ Why you should learn algorithms.

The importance of learning algorithms in
â­• Improve program execution time.
â­• Correct use of memory.
â­• Simplify the code due to the reliance on clear and easy to understand steps
